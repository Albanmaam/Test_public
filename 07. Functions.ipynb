    "You now know how to run Python code, assign variables, and write control flow statements, which allows us to write programs that can do calculations. In fact, this is all you *really* need to write programs (except for being able to read in and write out data which we will talk about later). However, with only this, programs will quickly become very long and unreadable. So one very important rule in programming is to **avoid repetition**."
